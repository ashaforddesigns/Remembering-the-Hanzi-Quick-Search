# Remembering the Simplified Hanzi Quick Search (using Python) :mahjong: :cn:
## Project Goals
- Create a quick search through all 3000 of James Heisig by using the character or the keyword
- Eventually, I want to be able to add an "additional notes" section that could be added when keyword or character is searched

### Special Thanks
Thank you [PavelDanov](https://gist.github.com/PavelDanov/176fc3904d384155a041aa8a0778f494) for the list of Heisig's simplified hanzi letters already in .txt format
