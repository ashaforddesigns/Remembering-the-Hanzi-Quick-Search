# Remembering the Simplified Hanzi Quick Search (using Python) :mahjong: :cn:
## Project Goals :star:
- Create a quick search through all 3000 of James Heisig by using the character or the keyword
- Allow the user to add notes, which could be their own story that they use to remember the hanzi

## Tasks :lightbulb:
- Search for a Remembering the Simplified Hanzi "keyword" (Heisig's keywords)
    - This will return the associated hanzi.
    - You can then add a note which will be assoicated with the entire entry (both the hanzi and the keyword). I frequently add my own personal stories that help me remember the hanzi

- Search for a hanzi found in Remembering the Simplified Hanzi
    - If it appears in the book, the program will return the associated keyword
    - You can then add a note which will be assoicated with the entire entry (both the hanzi and the keyword)

#### Future improvements
This program could be improved by adding the hanzi's elements. For example, searching for the hanzi Êêè could bring up the elements "fingers" & "gummed label"
